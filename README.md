# User management - recruitment task

Recruitment task.

## Descriptions

A very simple application for managing members. This application has two basic functions. First, find a member by name and view it as results. The second is the function of adding a member (name and age) to DB.


### Env Variables

In this case .env file doesn't has any sensitive data that's why I include it with repo

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5000

```


### Install Dependencies (backend)

```
$ npm install

```

### Run

```
# Run frontend & backend 
$ npm run start

# Run frontend only
$ npm run client

# Run backend only
$ npm run server
```

### Database

You can set different database in backend/db/db.js
